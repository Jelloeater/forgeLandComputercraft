ONLY WORKS WITH ComputerCraft 1.4 and higher!

For a full recursive download of your ComputerCraft programs from your BitBucket
repository follow these steps.
1) Copy the following line to your ComputerCraft terminal and press enter:

pastebin get qMKd0B0g init

2) When the download finishes type "init" and press enter.

This will download the two files necessary for the automated update and execute them.
You can edit the file "/bb/prog/bitbucket" to use your own BitBucket repository instead of mine.
Any time after this initial install just type "init" to download the latest version of your BitBucket repository.
