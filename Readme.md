If you go on ANY computer (on forgeLand) and type "init" it will pull the code from the repo. The boot strap file is located in ComputerCraft1.58.zip\assets\computercraft\lua\rom\programs in the mods folder on the server.

To pull latest code down, re-run init in /src directory

**NOTE** *All code goes in the ccsrc folder, then in your personal folder. /src is strictly for API's and other global stuff.*

Awesome Code from DerTroglodyt

ONLY WORKS WITH ComputerCraft 1.4 and higher!

This will download the two files necessary for the automated update and execute them.
You can edit the file "/bb/prog/bitbucket" to use your own BitBucket repository instead of mine.
Any time after this initial install just type "init" to download the latest version of your BitBucket repository.
